# Creator of 2D maps of galaxies from cosmological simulations 
A repository for creating 2D spatially-resolved maps of stellar properties of galaxies from cosmological simulations. 
Currently, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE cosmological simulations are supported. 
These maps can be used for simulation-based inference.

## Background
Cosmological simulations like [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/) and [EAGLE](https://eagle.strw.leidenuniv.nl/wordpress/) are able to reproduce realistic galaxies. To be able to compare their products with real galaxies, we need to create 2D maps of observable stellar properties from simulations by integrated the 3D space of particles to a 2D projection.
