# Creator of 2D maps of galaxies from cosmological simulations 
A repository for creating 2D spatially-resolved maps of stellar properties of galaxies from cosmological simulations. 
Currently, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE cosmological simulations are supported. 
These maps can be used for simulation-based inference.
